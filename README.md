InVEST Dashboards

About this application
=========================

These applications allow an [InVEST](http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest) user to view a set of model results interactively in a web browser and to share that view with others by sharing only a URL. Modeling almost always requires iteration and repitition. Quickly viewing the results of your latest model, to find errors or to see what has changed, makes the whole process more efficient. Applications are available for InVEST's [Coastal Vulnerability](http://vulpes.sefs.uw.edu/ttapp/cv-dash.php) and [Habitat Risk Assessment model](http://vulpes.sefs.uw.edu/ttapp/hra-dash.php). The Recreation dashboard is no longer compatible with the latest version of InVEST. 

In general, not all of the results produced by an InVEST run are displayed in these applications.
You may wish to explore and analyze your results further with GIS or data analysis software.
